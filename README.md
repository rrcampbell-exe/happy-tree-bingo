## Usage
To play Happy Tree Bingo, tune in to the [Hence Fort Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/hence_fort) on Friday afternoons between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. central time. 

During gameplay, I'll perform certain tasks or make certain statements that match criteria laid out on the randomly populated bingo spaces on the Happy Tree Bingo card. 

When one of these tasks is performed or statements are made, click the corresponding bingo space on your bingo card. 

Once you have a completed row, diagonal, or column, post an image of your bingo card to the Hence Fort Discord server (link found in app). 

After your bingo card has been validated as a winner, you can choose to join me live on a future stream or have me plant another tree with OneTreePlanted.org.
